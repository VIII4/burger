# Eat-Da-Burger (Burger)

---

Burger creation and devour app powered by Javascript, NODE, Express.js, MYSQL, Handlebars and Heroku

##### Eat-da-burger is a one page app that allows user to create and add burgers to database, which can be later devoured, updated and placed in devoured list.

##### The app uses a MVC structure with a custom ORM to handle SQL interactions. Also in effort to deploy on heroku, Jaws_db add on was used for cloud database.

### Instructions

---

##### On home page, create burger by creating input and pressing add button, page will refresh with all burgers displayed in all burgers column. Find the burger you want to devour and click devour button, burger will be removed from column and added to devoured.

### Challenges

Creating custom ORM proved to be difficult, but the modular nature of it allowed me to learn more efficient method of writing code
